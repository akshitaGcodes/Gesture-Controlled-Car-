# Gesture-Controlled-Car-
A DIY robotics project that uses hand gestures to navigate a car in real-time. No joystick instead  drive with just a wave of your hand! Built with Arduino, an MPU6050 accelerometer, and NRF24L01 wireless modules.

**Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to replace traditional joystick controllers with intuitive hand gestures. By tilting a wearable "glove" or transmitter, the user can control the direction and speed of the vehicle.

Key Features
Wireless Control: Real-time data transmission via 2.4GHz RF.

Precision Sensing: 6-axis motion tracking (Accelerometer + Gyro).

Differential Steering: Smooth turning logic implemented via PWM.

Safety Lock: Automatic stop when no signal is detected.
