Communication: NRF24L01 / HC-05
Logic: Reads X and Y angles; maps them to directional commands


2. The Receiver (Car)
Processor: Arduino Nano 
Signal Receiver : NRF24L01 + PA + LNA & Adapter
Motor Driver: L298N Dual H-Bridge
Actuators: DC Gear Motors
Logic: Receives commands and adjusts motor polarity and speed.
