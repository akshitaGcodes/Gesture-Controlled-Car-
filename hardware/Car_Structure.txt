Components :-
4 motors
1 Arduino Nano
1 NRF24L01 + Adapter
1 Breadboard
1 L289N
1 Battery Source

Motor Driver - L289N Connections :-

Output 1 -> +ve Right Motors
Output 2 -> -ve Right Motors
Output 3 -> +ve Left Motors
Output 4 -> -ve Left Motors

+ 12 V -> connected to +ve rail , (then connected to battery)
GND    -> connected to -ve rail , (then connected to battery)
+5 V   -> connected to +ve rail , (different rail then +12 V )

Enable A -> D5
Enable B -> D6

Input 1 -> D2
Input 2 -> D3
Input 3 -> D4
Input 4 -> D7

Receiver - NRF24L01 Connections :-
VCC  -> +5V
GND  -> Gnd Rail 
CSE  -> D8
CSN   -> D9
SCK  -> D13
MO -> D11
MI -> D12
IRO  -> Left vaccant

Battery Connections :-
+ve -> to +ve rail(where motor driver's 12 V is connected)
-ve -> to all gnds and -ve's
